# landing-page
### An exercise from The Odin project (https://www.theodinproject.com/)

To refresh my knowledge of website development during winter break 2024, I took on The Odin Project, and create this basic landing page. It's been a while since the last time I built a website project, so it took me quite a bit of time (3 hours) to build everything from scratch. Through this exercise, I have better understanding of Flexbox and website layout.
