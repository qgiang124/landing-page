To refresh my knowledge of website development during the Winter break of 2024, I took on The Odin Project, and created this basic landing page. It's been a while since the last time I built a website project, so it took me quite a bit of time (3 hours) to build everything from scratch. Through this exercise, I have a better understanding of Flexbox and website layout.
